Chromesthesia
===========
**A Web-Application for Sound Visualization using WebGL**

 *** 
This application is created by Grand Valley State University students for their Senior Project.

[Please see the Wiki](https://github.com/MattShrider/WebGL-Music/wiki) for a link to Journals and icebreakers.

Chromesthesia will eventually become a Web Application which allows users to upload music, or grab music from
online sources, such as Youtube or SoundCloud.  These files will be opened in your browser, and when they 
are played, a 3D Scene will attempt to visualize the sound, based on Loudness and Frequency.

Additionally, users will be able to customize their user interface to an extent, and even modify the music by
changing pitch, adding reverb, or other common elements.  Additional music tracks could be added and mixed with
what is currently running.
