Chromesthesia is a music player which visualizes the current song using Three.JS.  It uses the Web Audio API, which is 
a relatively new standard for using sounds in the browser.

Chromesthesia will include multiple 3d-scenes for visualizing music, as well has a configurable audio pipeline for 
adding effects to the song.
